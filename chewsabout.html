                <h4>Youâ€™ve stumbled upon an unstoppable and actionable strategy for freedom.</h4>
                <p>Let us rally around a common cause as opposed to a common enemy. Freedom is not only about not being bound by the current monstrous systems. Freedom is also measured by the ability to do what you want without repercussions. We might be on an individual level removing ourselves from many of the unnecessary taxes upon our lives, but there are still many paths that are blocked by the current system. It should be easy and available for anyone to enter into a profession they desire, or to create an entirely new profession for themselves without unnecessary bloated restrictions, allowing for the free market to deliver goods and services based upon consumer desires. There is a way forward, and we are the ones to create it.
