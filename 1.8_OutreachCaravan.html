 <h1>Caravanarchy</h1>
<h2><strong>Our Bus, The Time Machine</strong></h2>
<p>We are creating time and helping people with their time. You can use this as a model to create your own caravan or community.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is a concept that people who live in houses tend to have. This concept is that in order to establish roots in a community, one must settle down in a singular location where in time, they'll make close friends and build or find community. This is one strategy but need not be the only way to make lasting bonds with others who share the same goals. How often do your neighbors share your exact views? How often do people move to your town who share your goals? Caravanarchy is a way of establishing a team of individuals who share the common objective of making the world more free for themselves wherever they are while maximizing freedom for the individual and growing one's network, team, or communities (yes, road life WILL expose you to multiple communities of people) by offering a superior alternative to the statist-quo.</p>
<p>We have a unique perspective based on our exposure to a diverse demographic of communities. Our crew becomes historians and philosophers just by way of road life.</p>
<h4>Networking &amp; Locational Flexibility: More than just a bug-out plan.</h4>
<p>Those who have no bills are among the most wealthy of all, because they bask in an abundance of time. Always be prepared to leave your current location and at least survive long-term at a secondary location, if not nomadically. This gives one a true sense of freedom in an unfree world because if you don&rsquo;t like your situation, you truly can leave it.</p>
<h3><strong>What we offer:</strong></h3>
<p>Both network host (accepting new members to be vetted for further network involvement) and welcome outpost, the caravan blends these capabilities while retaining wings focused on outreach, protection, and whatever other topics the current team cares about. Shelter/Housing can be brought or provided by the caravan in a win/win exchange.</p>
<p>The caravan is the current primary creator of abundance loops within the network. But we are not the network in itself. We are network support. Our network is designed to protect ourselves and others by having backup networks in multiple states.</p>
<p>We hold a marketplace everywhere we go. Festivals for up to a month duration anywhere we park. Visiting properties will have the structure they want to have.</p>
<h4>We go to a city. We set up a temporary camp on the outskirts of that city. We draw people in and give them tools to connect with people from their own lives as well as new friends with similar goals.</h4>
<h4>We are a machine designed to create the changes we want to make.&nbsp;</h4>
<p>We are peddling voluntaryism, not labor. We do talks and discussions. And we have the vision to create the lore. We are the bards.</p>
<p>The Workshop is a separate and complimentary gathering within the voluntarism outreach team that consists of people who teach certain skills and travel around or stay in one place offering information.</p>
<ul>
<li>Outreach - go forth and form new voluntarist communities</li>
<li>Information - Cultivate and make available voluntaryist information and art</li>
<li>Culture - Create festivals, stories, and voluntaryist media. Seminars wherever we go, creating communities wherever we go.</li>
</ul>
<p>We offer a place for everyone to go and, if they see it necessary, for them to never return to their old lives. Whether they want to learn a trade in an association, start their own business, or just live free on land arbitrated by no ruler. The free land we have will build itself up with the hands of people who know their labor is going towards something that will support them in the future.</p>
<p>We will meet up with people in different cities to start new festivals. We spend a month in an area at a time, where the caravan can recoup and secure gas money for the next destination. The main caravan will focus on a new location vs an older location but yearly festivals will persist and other caravans will go wherever they please.</p>
<p>We retain a unique perspective based on our exposure to a diverse demographic of communities. We are historians and philosophers with a large sphere of influence. We do not need donations nearly as much as we need people on the ground. But donations will go towards a network that will provide for every one of us in the ways we want and need from our community.</p>
<h3><strong>Core Principles:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>All interactions/exchanges are net positive - win/win</li>
<li>Everyone agrees to the NAP</li>
<li>For all, we support movement throughout associations to find their true passion.</li>
<li>Self-Reliance</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Caravan Offerings</strong></h3>
<h3><strong>Slow-Traveling Faire</strong></h3>
<p>We will go to an area for a month or more at a time and during that time we will focus on forming a group capable of continuing the Voluntary Welcome Hub and Freedom Hub full-time. We will also focus on setting up recurring meetups and a festival that can help bring people into the network. We will have a constant presence during that time. Shelter/Housing can be brought or provided by those in the area, if not found on BLM lands.</p>
<p>You will wake up every day knowing where the central caravan location is. That location is somewhere where you can meet people, craft, and trade. Sometimes there is no main camp and the people in the caravan do outreach in the town because there is not a central meeting location possible. In this case, the caravan will be centered around a certain known friendly location.</p>
<p>In this way, each vehicle in the caravan can be stationed in its most strategic location and the center of the caravan does not depend on the presence of any one vehicle at that location. That location becomes a welcome hub location and anarchists at that location can provide welcome hub services.</p>
<h1><br /><br /></h1>
<h4>The Nightly Production/Show:</h4>
<p>Performers</p>
<p>Merchants</p>
<p>Craftspeople</p>
<p>Problem Solvers</p>
<p>Cafe or Food Makers</p>
<h4>The Daily Offerings</h4>
<p>Writers</p>
<p>Bounty Fillers</p>
<p>Mechanics</p>
<p>The main location for the caravan will be where the Nightly Presentment takes place. People can always park wherever they wish, near or far. There will be a separate silent area designated for those who wish to camp quietly and visit the offerings from farther away.</p>
<h1><br /><br /></h1>
<h3><strong>Caraveneers Wanted!</strong></h3>
<h4>We have a system for saving people from the cities</h4>
<p>We have a one-ton truck, a 35 ft 5th wheel, a car, and an extended van with a bed built out.</p>
<p>The idea is to help everyone who is having trouble redirecting their income stream and expenditures to purely agorist sources - so that we can keep the wealth in the family and grow a system that will stand resolute against all threats. Our caravan is growing - and with it sprouts new spaces for people who don&rsquo;t yet have a vehicle to sleep in of their own. Everywhere we go, we have a huge camp offering and tables set up inviting folks to learn about the opportunities available in this ever-growing agorist network.</p>
<h4>We have a solution for your lowest moment</h4>
<p>We are here for you. Do you have a way to protect yourself? Need to get away or need another house? We&rsquo;ll provide the details you provide the specs - let's all be more sure about what we're gonna get.</p>
<h4>Van Lifer? Become a Bounty Bringer!</h4>
<p>Bounties are like wanted ads. You can ask people for things they want and add them to the bounty board. You may then complete these bounties or pick up bounties that already exist on the board.</p>
<h3><strong>Lifestyles for Freedom</strong></h3>
<p>There are different tiers of positions on the caravan. There are temporary travelers and there are full-time crew. You always fill some position. Every position is a win-win relationship. The basic position is a traveler. Travelers pay for their own gas and insurance on their own vehicle or a vehicle in the fleet they are renting. Rental vehicles also have a charge for paperwork and another for wear and tear. There will be many positions available.</p>
<p>If you come on our caravan, you will get these great benefits:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>You will wake up every day knowing where the central caravan location is.&nbsp;</li>
<li>The central location is where you can meet people, craft and trade, and more.</li>
</ul>
<p>Rarely, there is no central location and the people in the caravan do outreach in the town. In this case, the caravan main camp will be centered around aknown friendly location.&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Bringing Everybody Along</strong></h2>
<p>You don&rsquo;t need to become a nomad - it&rsquo;s just highly suggested to take some time decompressing from the stressors of your life. This can be done either on the road or at a stationary location.</p>
<p>Many needs are fulfilled by our caravan. The point is not to have people coming along with us but to connect people with things they need. We can use our boon to share with others what we have in excess.</p>
<h1><br /><br /></h1>
<h4>This is way better than a road trip.</h4>
<p>On vacation, you are always going back to where you came from. If you don&rsquo;t end up rushing, you still miss out on all the things you didn't have time for. You budgeted your time.</p>
<h4>Looking for people to connect with in all of these areas to help expand the network:</h4>

<h1>To Be Mobile?</h1>
<h3><strong>How to Become Nomadic</strong></h3>
<p>Not a nomad but want to be? We have several mobile spaces available if you have a vehicle but not one you can sleep in. Help with one of the jobs listed or live and work for yourself (preferably within the network), paying minimal rent and your own gas while following our caravan. Or you can trade your car into the network for barter.</p>
<h3><strong>Nomad Questions:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>How is your life improved by being mobile? Is it a monetary boon?</li>
<li>Is your lifestyle or profession helped by being mobile?</li>
<li>What&rsquo;s your reason/end goal for being on this caravan specifically?</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Benefits Of Mobile Life</strong></h3>
<p>Real-life testimonial &ldquo;All my time is used better now. I can spend time dictating notes into my phone and calling people while driving. Life isn&rsquo;t something where you&rsquo;re only being useful if you&rsquo;re being paid for it. I get my best thinking done while driving. And I get other things done while driving that I would&rsquo;ve had to multitask while doing anyways.&rdquo;</p>
