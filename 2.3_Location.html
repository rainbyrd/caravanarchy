<h1>Transcending Location:</h1>
<p>There has to be a reason behind what you do. The location you choose should be the best to serve that reason.</p>
<h2><strong>Locational Philosophy</strong></h2>
<p>The question is not whether to be stationary or nomadic, but to have a holistic plan for whatever option you do choose to go with at any point in time.</p>
<p>And a holistic understanding of the pros and cons of each and how to transfer in between them.</p>
<p>A location is only as safe as the contingency plan and its feasibility.</p>
<p>Any one location is vulnerable. Having a backup is a step up. Having a huge network of people is closer to the objective by far. Every member of the network has some way to contribute to the Security Mesh.</p>
<p>If people in your area desire to stay in a situation where a huge amount of their paycheck is going towards taxes and towards people who are also funding the state, it&rsquo;s probably a better idea to find different people or an area with people who are more willing to take seriously the task at hand. It is a lot bigger than just buying more agorist food. It is making sure that the work you are doing is also leading towards a more free future.</p>
<h2><strong>Healthy Habitation</strong></h2>

<h3><strong>Locational Philosophy</strong></h3>
<h3><strong>Healthy Habitation</strong></h3>
<h4><em>Nomadic or Stationary: Where We Fit With You</em></h4>
<h4><em>Become a Nomadic or Stationary Bountier</em></h4>
<h3><strong>Agora Locations</strong></h3>
<h4><em>Voluntary Welcome Hub</em></h4>
<h4><em>Free Market Hub</em></h4>
<h4><em>Nomadic/Temporary Hubs</em></h4>

<h1><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></h1>
<h3><strong>Nomadic or Stationary: Where We Fit with You</strong></h3>
<p>A person needs a period to look at their life and figure what they would like to contribute. If you don&rsquo;t know yet, there are safe locations you can go to to be free of the restrictions of debt and rent that keep you chained.</p>
<p>There is no need to commit to one type of living when life is long and opportunities could take you anywhere. You can never know when your paradigm will shift or your plan A will become unavailable - that is why having redundancies and resilient networks is vital to our freedom. Each stage of regenerative land use and development is important and none can be left out. There are boons to both stationary and mobile locations when it comes to homes, projects and businesses alike. And there are cells that intersect these spaces in different ways and many do not depend on one length of stay in any location.</p>
<h3><strong>Become a Nomadic or Stationary Bountier</strong></h3>
<p>You can choose to create an anonymous profile on the website. When you join, it will ask you to start a bounty, to get you connected to the network immediately wherever you are in your journey.</p>
<h4>Bounty Example:</h4>
<ul>
<li><em><em>What do you want to do buy or sell</em></em></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><em>What do you want&nbsp;</em></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><em>What are you doing</em></li>
</ul>
<p>What&rsquo;s actionable in your life right now? What would bring you into the next phase of your life?</p>
<h4>How to Become Nomadic</h4>
<p>Not a nomad but want to be? If you have a vehicle but not one you can sleep in, we have several mobile spaces available to live and work for yourself (preferably within the network), paying minimal rent and your own gas while following our caravan. Or you can trade your car into the network for barter.</p>
<h4>Spotlight: Van Girl</h4>
<p>What options did she have? And I mean, taking account of moral options? Not just by scraping by, working for evil corporations. Working on a farm isn&rsquo;t an easy option, but nothing is easy. But she didn&rsquo;t have time for herself. So she follows her own dreams now.</p>
<p>Living a life unplugged from any forms of propaganda telling her what to do. Having to co-create a lie along with other prison mates no more.</p>
<h1>Agora Locations</h1>
<h1><br /><strong><br /></strong></h1>
<h3><strong>Voluntary Welcome Hub</strong></h3>
<p>A location with a Voluntary Welcome Desk</p>
<h3><strong>Freedom/Free Market Hubs</strong></h3>
<p>Safe location for voluntaryists. Locations where people can live and work with no limitations or live and not work at all. A place to detox from society and figure out what you would be doing.</p>
<p>For those who don&rsquo;t see the value at this time in their life being a nomad, there are 0% impact properties where your presence can pay your rent at a location where you will be able to think, express yourself and hone in on what whatever you really value and desire; be it monetary, community, or personal. Humans deserve the space to grieve. They deserve enough space to take care of themselves.</p>
<h4>Public Agoras / Places of Exchange</h4>
<p>A safe location that welcomes all Voluntaryist interactions.</p>
<h3><strong>Outer City Tribe Locations</strong></h3>
<p>Every city can have a mobile help center that consists of any vehicles that are being used as help vehicles in the vicinity in question. These will be mobile or stationary. Ideally, these welcome centers include the amenities of a 24-hour helpdesk, but it is not required.</p>
<p>If there is not a festival around a certain metroplex, the people in that area can organize one and the caravan will come. Or if there is already an existing festival, a welcome crew can develop to provide year-round marketplace opportunities and agorist support to people in that area. It is not easy to be powerful with others and less you are acting in ways that are empowering.</p>
<p>Living/Creating Spaces</p>
<p>Healing/Support Spaces</p>
<p>Entertainment/Party/Trade Spaces</p>
<h3><strong>Inner City Outposts</strong></h3>
<p>There is a reason to be in the city. There is culture, and there are tons of lost souls waiting to be found. Here are some other things that exist in cities:</p>
<p>City Escape Routes Network</p>
<p>Welcome Desk Locations</p>
<p>Places to stay while traveling</p>
<p>Item storage/horde/cache/vehicle storage</p>
<h3><strong>Association Hubs</strong></h3>
<h4>Day in the life of someone at an Association Hub or Outpost</h4>
<p>People have already built what they need to take care of themselves. Respect for private property is key on all properties and outposts and people will not be required to share resources.</p>
<h3><strong>Association-Specific Locations</strong></h3>
<p>These are locations that specific Associations manage. They are locations that might offer housing or training and apprenticeships.</p>
<h3><strong>Multi-Association Faires</strong></h3>
<p>Associations can put on faires together to support a larger group of people and trade knowledge and ideas between them.</p>
<h3><strong>Free use Lands</strong></h3>
<p>Crowdsourced lands that will be available for people to live in cost free. No amenities will be initially provided but those who live there will develop it as they see fit.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The land will build itself up with the hands of people who know their labor is going towards something that will support them in the future.</p>
<h1><br /><br /></h1>
<h2><strong>Nomadic/Temporary Hubs:</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>The Caravan</strong></h3>
<p>The caravan itself can be seen as an Agorist hub and vetting location. The caravan enables people to get on their feet but the cost of living is much higher in the caravan than on one of the free lands. A person has to have a trade if they want to make money while on the road.</p>
<h4>Caravan Outposts</h4>
<p>Anywhere that is homesteaded for a month or more becomes a caravan outpost.&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Find your farms</strong></h3>
<p>One of the most important things is helping people find their farmers. You need to be able to locate local beef and produce when it&rsquo;s not necessarily a resource that is easy to find. We need to keep our farmers protected and make sure that they can produce more.</p>
<h1><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></h1>
<h1>Transportation Hub</h1>

<h3><strong>Free Use Lands</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Unpaid Land</li>
