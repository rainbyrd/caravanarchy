<h1>The Network</h1>
<h5>You&rsquo;ve stumbled upon an unstoppable and actionable strategy for freedom.</h5>
<p>Let us rally around a common cause as opposed to a common enemy. Freedom is not only about not being bound by the current monstrous systems. Freedom is also measured by the ability to do what you want without repercussions. We might be on an individual level removing ourselves from many of the unnecessary taxes upon our lives, but there are still many paths that are blocked by the current system. It should be easy and available for anyone to enter into a profession they desire, or to create an entirely new profession for themselves without unnecessary bloated restrictions, allowing for the free market to deliver goods and services based upon consumer desires. There is a way forward, and we are the ones to create it.</p>
<h2><strong>The True Realm is HERE!</strong></h2>
<p>You do not need to try to create the next world from scratch from your current location or local community. Instead of trying to influence a change in the lifestyle of those still resistant to the idea of protected free communities, you can combine your efforts with those who share your intentions and who already see the vision of what is possible in this lifetime.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You could spend a lifetime trying to persuade others to see the vision and become active enough in changing their own lives. But there is a quicker way to achieve freedom. Though some people have the drive and desire to be at the forefront of a dispersed community that values and protects their freedom to peacefully interact and transact without repercussions, we can&rsquo;t wait for those people to come out of the woodwork to begin creating a new free way of living. Word of mouth takes time to propagate. Most people can&rsquo;t be expected to change when there isn&rsquo;t an obvious and well-worn path towards a new way of living.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It will require a relatively small dispersed group of people who not only are interested in a new world but who are prepared to take actions in their lives to create an alternate ecosystem for each other, replacing streams of resources from the exploitative system with the networked goods and services of protected free markets. This does not mean an end to the importation and production of goods, but simply to better sources of them. Sources that do not, for example, fund the war machine, enslavement, and mass-incarceration of human beings.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Until this alternative network is more ubiquitous, it will be hard for individuals to abandon their current lifestyle and transfer all their income and expenditures over to these free and ethical sources. There are already people spread out across the country and world who are prepared to make that shift in a way that creates more opportunities for everyone seeking a free way of life.</p>
<p>The larger community is made up of individuals who have the skills and knowledge necessary to support one another. What support does the individual need from a network? Every good or service you spend money on can be re-sourced. Medical care, insurance, gasoline, jobs, and education to name a few. Everything that drives the world today can be provided in a better way by the community.</p>
<h3><strong>Making The Switch</strong></h3>
<p>We do not need to escape this world. We have everything we need here to create the next phase of existence. This is the world that, in time, becomes the ideal world for each individual. How can each person have their own ideal coexisting with every other person&rsquo;s ideal, simultaneously? The answer is voluntary pluralism.</p>
<p>To get a more concise and potent result, we are more concise with our parameters. We are not judging those who do not follow these parameters, but we are making a distinction within our own decisions to do business with others who are actively creating more freedom for others instead of creating only a space for themselves to temporarily reduce their own oppression while doing little to manifest or support protected free markets.</p>
<h4><em>We believe in real solutions, right now!</em></h4>
<p>We do not want to spend our lives working for other people&rsquo;s goals while doing nothing or very little toward what we are in this realm to achieve, which has nothing to do with slaving away for money.</p>
<p>This is a guide to the establishment of a society that is independent, interconnected, and free from coercion. Today, we have everything we need to circumvent the state entirely. Communities small and large are already flourishing all around the world, and what is lacking in the common lore is a larger and more liberating story we can all manifest into reality.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The next sections will address the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>People don&rsquo;t see an option</li>
<li>We are creating an option</li>
<li>You can create an option</li>
</ol>
<p>Understanding what is possible will lead to a more extensive awareness and empowered utilization of these communities, both with each other and by those still more entrenched in the slave society.</p>

<h1><em>Igniting the Engine</em></h1>
<h4><em>The Infrastructure for Freedom</em></h4>
<p>Our model does not require capital to run. It is a framework that can be applied to help others better utilize their time and resources toward safeguarding freedom. We do not need donations nearly as much as we need people on the ground, explaining what is possible and available to us right now and also creating the next level of possibilities. This network will help those seeking protected free markets to transition from a state of surviving to one of thriving.</p>
<p>Eventually, the network will provide a place for everyone, and, if they see it necessary, a path away from everything about their current way of living. Whether they want to learn a trade in an Association, start their own Association or profession, or just live free on land arbitrated by no ruler, there are countless reasons why choosing freedom for yourself is an obvious and beneficial path. Life can be easier, more profitable and there is more time in the day when the fruits of your productive energy aren&rsquo;t being siphoned away into the wasteful and unethical games of politicians and well-meaning voters. Similarly, there is more incentive to work when you know your labor is going towards something that will support you more and more as time goes on. We will share more on that in the next chapter.</p>
<h4><em>We are the Support Network. And we are igniting the engine.&nbsp;</em></h4>
<p>We are not creating the network. The network exists already, though small. The full potential of the network will manifest when it is given the right push and intention. Instead, you can see us as network support. We are devoting our entire lives and livelihoods to creating a stronger bond between those who are already constituting the network and encouraging a larger vision for how we can take on the needs of our dispersed freedom-supporting community members and markets in every way.</p>
<p>A peaceful society is possible based on a truly simple concept: that no man should aggress upon another or their property as an extension of their existence in this realm. All associations between individuals or groups must be voluntary and consensual. No person or group of persons should be given freedom to aggress. Justice comes from restitution, so victims must be free to exact restitution from their aggressor(s). Individuals who are the targets of aggression should not be prevented from the exercise of defensive force in opposition. We recognise this as the Non-Aggression Principle (NAP) paired with the Self-Defense Principle (SDP) and the Principle of Restitution (PoR). We can pave the way for an organic and voluntary society based on these precepts alone, but to do that requires more than just encouraging each person to spread a culture of voluntaryism in their current immediate surroundings. Even small communities of voluntaryists can not create a voluntaryist society in the larger world unless they share a larger vision for freedom beyond their own domain and take action to join and help create the network of protected free markets.</p>
<p>When you make your voluntary groupings, make sure to look at what is created.Are you producing more freedom for others beyond your circle? This is not an altruistic approach, but promotes a realistic understanding of how each smaller group relies upon an interconnected network in order to survive. Not only does every group interact with the larger society in some large or small ways which affect their life and wellbeing outside of their control, but any one group cannot get all of their needs met by their individual members. You need to import products and services. To do this, you must expand your inner network to collaborate with others in your broader community who share in your desire to create safe and thriving free markets and establish protected and trusted trade and social networks.</p>
<p>We also understand that the stress of high mortgages and &ldquo;taxes&rdquo; (government extortion) makes wealth accumulation more difficult and that is why we are creating the infrastructure (the bounty board, helping to meet the needs of our network of individuals intent on protecting and supporting a free way of life) to create affordable housing and jobs that pay more while not extorting taxes from the people involved. Nobody will be turned away for lack of funds. Instead, we will select our allegiances based on the goal and vision of each individual.</p>
<h4><em>The Perpetual Engine</em></h4>
<p>Every organization or organism has parameters it is working to achieve and maintain. Another similarity between these two is that like an organism, the way an organization is formed and the mechanisms that bring it to life will determine the outcome it achieves in its environment.</p>
<p>This is why we have the engine. We are creating a bulletproof mechanism and strategy, so that even if large parts of it are destroyed, all it needs is one hearth, aka one wing of the network, to light up in some distant land and our engine is going again.</p>
<p>We do not need any one leg of the engine to survive continuously for the engine to roll on. Any single hearth can turn its engine on and off, but there will always be more engines firing and producing the change we need to move past the current binds we live under and into a realm of voluntaryism for all.</p>
<p>When we create certain additional criteria for our interactions in addition to the NAP (which already underlies all of our interactions) we assure that our interactions will make the largest impact possible in the community that supports us.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We need a community to support us in these ways: security, backups, community, etc. The everyday society we have come to know is not providing for us in the ways we need, and we are being led to erroneously think ourselves powerless over our current state of mass-human-enslavement.</p>
<p>Having a protected community requires vigilance, decentralization, sound principles, and a plurality of voluntary strategies aimed at meeting needs.</p>
<h4>What will success look like?</h4>
<p><em>The worst evil is people still believing and perpetuating the lie that they have to be controlled by the government. Your way of living should be an act of rebellion that helps make people&rsquo;s choice for freedom a no-brainer.</em></p>
<p>Our idea is strengthened by its many unique attributes. Unlike a proposal that requires massive funding to get off the ground, this idea is aimed at people who are already trying to make a living who hopefully already have resources invested in themselves and could benefit from shifting their business towards a tax-free network that will help them out. The success of this network is not tied to any individual&rsquo;s success. We (Caravanarchy) are simply network support, and others can replace our role should some tragedy befall our specific wing of support. What we are describing is a lifestyle and resource-allocation strategy. The more people get empowered by it, the stronger it gets and the more everyone involved benefits.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are creating this guidebook and an online presence that will do much more to help those specific individuals who want to make a change and commit to these endeavors in a way that makes a difference. Join us in creating a world immune from institutionalized tyranny!</p>
<h2><strong><em>The Purpose of this Guide</em></strong></h2>
<p>This is a guide on the scope of what is possible in the next 1-10 years. This is not a guide on how to create a voluntaryist society starting where you are with only the resources present in your community. Spreading freedom (and a voluntaryist society) requires that you first take care of your personal need for autonomy and freedom. It also will eventually require intentional choices aimed at starving and bleeding the enemy (the State) while supporting and bolstering your allies and friends in freedom.</p>
<p>The first step is to ascertain whether relocation or nomadic living might be the most lucrative way to achieve your short-term goals while transitioning out of the non-agorist system<em> (</em><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1hqTxWCkwjb49n6mBRmQCCAiaCBzkcRa08p07mRqXD0I/edit"><em>What is Agorism?</em></a><em>)</em>.There will be properties available for short or long-term living rent and work-free while you detox from society or re-evaluate your goals. These will be voluntary properties and will take shape depending on the unanimous consent of the people who live there.</p>
<h4>Our Mission</h4>
<h5><em>Do you believe in a society where all interactions are voluntary and consensual?</em></h5>
<p>This book presents a path for every person towards a life that is more aligned with the expression of their true potential and desires. This book also serves as an introduction to a network that already exists in its formative levels and aims to soon provide clean, freedom-oriented alternatives for every need a person may have.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This guide is to help you figure out your next move. It is full of plans of action and resources for collaboration. In every chapter, strategies are provided that can be used to meet every need. The bounty board and social boards connect individuals with available resources. Without the leeching and constraint of the state, everyone can live a free and fulfilling life they can be proud of. This requires discipline, intention, and a willingness to adapt one's lifestyle toward bringing about a more free world for themselves and others. It will also require our continued vigilance in keeping our markets safe from aggressors.</p>
<p>We are cultivating a world of decentralized and interconnected voluntary relationships between equals; because that is the only possible just future. There is no free world in which force or coercion can persist unchecked, <em>much less become institutionalized</em>. Because of the concise nature of our plan, the outcome of this is going to be something more abundant than seems possible in these bleak times.</p>
<p>Those who participate will enjoy the bounty once-stolen from them by the State, while enjoying a market constantly on the lookout for aggressors. They will enjoy a higher standard of living not only concerning material wealth, but also in that of social wealth and resilience gained through intentional networking. Participation can be done on many levels, both overtly and covertly.</p>
<h2><em>Part of our work is to make leaving the old destructive ways smart, easy, fun, and cool.</em></h2>
<p>In the current paradigm, we haven&rsquo;t been able to take a positive approach because, with the options given, there are no viable paths forward in which we are still maintaining our morals. Because most problems arise from the systemic problems associated with government control, we have an answer or better way of framing for all questions and issues brought up by the past and current society.</p>
<p>You do not need to leave the city to become an agorist. The goal is to disconnect your income, housing, and expenditures from the beast. The Network aims to provide you with truly free-market alternatives to the taxed and regulated markets.</p>
<p>When you are clear with your boundaries and vision, you can create an intentional network that will free humanity forever. With your intention in mind, cultivate the network links that lead you toward your goal rather than relying on organic growth alone. It is about changing who you support - and offering incentives for people to change with whom they do business with.</p>
<p>We need to get the word out and not bend to fear! We can create the future we want, right now!</p>
<h4><em>Other Goals:&nbsp;</em></h4>
<ul>
<li>Help people talk about and introduce others to Voluntaryism</li>
<li>Offer excitement and perspective with our real-world RPG</li>
<li>Connect people to resources and info in the alternate trading economy</li>
<li>Bolster supply and demand</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong><em>How to Utilize this Guide</em></strong></h2>
<p>They say that a better future starts with an internal change - that you start with yourself to make the world a better place. I don&rsquo;t think one person&rsquo;s actions can be enough to create the change needed. Let's all expand our ideas of what's possible.</p>
<p>This entire endeavor is focused on real solutions and pulling anarchists out of the current paradigm and placing them in the situations they need, regardless of the resources or money they have amassed as of yet in the zombie system. It&rsquo;s not too hard to opt-out if you have enough support. And this network is providing the extra support needed by those who don&rsquo;t already have a network supporting them.</p>
<h4>Get Involved Today</h4>
<p>For those who want to get involved but don&rsquo;t know how that would look, the caravan is the most immediate form of aid. We have 5 vehicles and the mobile camping infrastructure setup available where we can share the infrastructure to support a loose, slow-moving caravan with the aim of ending slavery today through education, agorism and encouraging the connection between new and already made alternative networks. We aim to engage in agorist business and networking in the towns and cities we travel through. Presently, Caravanarchy funds itself through donations and through multiple agorist business options we are equipped to employ. The aim is to create a marketplace every time we get to a new location, at which people in the nearby area can conduct their commerce in a safe and flourishing space.&nbsp;</p>
