  <h1>The Network</h1>
    <h2>The True Realm is HERE!</h2>
      <div class= "bodytext">
        <p>
        We do not need to escape this world. We have everything we need here to create the next phase of existence. This is the world that, in time, becomes the ideal world for each individual. How can each person have their own ideal coexisting with every other person’s ideal, simultaneously? The answer is voluntary pluralism. And the method we use to achieve reason is pragmatism. </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Pluralism: a condition or system in which two or more states, groups, principles, sources of authority, etc., coexist.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>//Pluralism regarding the State would necessitate a shift toward voluntary participation and funding, rather than extortion and threats.  This should not be a concern to the keen observer because we see voluntary participation and funding working everywhere in the private sector.  Pluralism puts the public’s choosing-power directly into the hands of its constituents while shielding the masses from any losses sustained by private-sector-imprudence.
                </li>
            </ul>
        <li>Voluntary Pluralism:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>//Pluralism replacing winner-takes-all politico-statism would take the perception of power and influence out of the hands of the powerful political elite while giving the public’s constituents (that is, each individual) their voice and power back.
                </li>
                <li>//Pluralism lends credence to the “if you don’t like it, you can leave” phrase in a voluntary society because you can always choose the other option(s) available and nobody has dominion beyond their actual property.
                </li>
                <li>//Because the cost of failure is borne by the private owner(s) of a voluntary organization rather than “society as a whole” who has no such investment at stake, and because customers are free to choose organizations that best suit their (the customer’s) individual preferences and needs, this is a guaranteed better strategy to meet the needs of humanity in communities of any size or scale…
                </li>
                <li>Pragmatism: a philosophical model that allows for growth in contracts and pluralistic law. 
                </li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <h2>Pragmatism: Contractual Language, Islands Of Truth</h2>
        <div class= "bodytext">
            <p>The idea that we hold the best possible model for our lives at each moment. We must be able to reassess our conclusions, as well as our methods for reaching conclusions, without losing the thread of reality or the ability to learn and grow from experience.<br><br>
            Pragmatism creates temporary islands of truth for one to jump between. It prescribes each individual to use their own judgment to make conclusions, each with its own necessitation. <br><br>
            It makes sense to start one’s philosophy from the assumption that this world is not a fake, projected “matrix” to be escaped from, but instead, that the best course of action is to assume that the world is something we can facilitate in taking its best possible form. The current limitations will be transcended eventually, and with enough concerted effort in a positive direction, that eventuality should be able to come pretty soon.<br><br>
            Pragmatism means there are islands of truth. Though we might not have the perfect grasp upon them, there are still real things/temporary facts that can be temporarily agreed upon and used as temporary variables in other discussions. The final truth to any one question does not need to be attained for there to be an agreed-upon temporary definition of one thing or another. If we use logical axioms and never stray into suppositions, there can still be a contractual language that makes sense.
