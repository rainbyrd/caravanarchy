  <h1>Voluntaryism, Plus</h1>
    <div class= "bodytext">
        <p>Conceptually, Voluntaryism is a very simple moral philosophy – it is the basic proposition that all human interaction should be directly consensual. Voluntaryism rejects the initiation of force in all its various forms including physical violence, threats of violence, theft, bullying, slavery, rape, murder, etc. However, unlike Pacifism, Voluntaryism does not bar the victim of coercion from responding in a strictly self-defensive manner.<br><br>
        -  Peter Miller, Introduction to Voluntaryism<br><br>

        We are voluntaryists with a cause.<br><br>
        We are practicing voluntaryism with a twist. Voluntaryism plus intention. To get a more concise and potent result, we are more concise with our parameters. We are not judging those who do not follow these parameters, but we are making a distinction within our own decisions.
        </p>
    </div>

<h2>Intro to Voluntaryism</h2>
    <div class= "bodytext">
        <p>Voluntaryism is the moral philosophy that all forms of interaction should be voluntary, and that the only just use of force is defensive force. <br><br>
        We abide by the Non-Aggression Principle (NAP) which dictates that no action be taken that violates another’s consent if not in self-defense.<br><br>
        Voluntaryism means only consensual interactions between individuals. It also implies that there are no rights that can be granted to an individual that aren’t shared by all individuals - such as any rights we grant the “government” to rule over our lives and livelihoods. Rights can neither be granted nor revoked. They are either respected or not.<br><br>
        Ultimately no one thinks that anyone should need to rule over them - especially someone that they didn’t choose themselves - which means no one really supports involuntary rulership over others. And yet due to a lack of options as well as various methods of social and psychological conditioning, many people think that some groups possess the right to intimidate and initiate force against others and enslave them.
        </p>
    </div>

<h2>An Exception for Self-Defense</h2>
    <div class= "bodytext">
        <p>Very few set out with the intent to hurt others unprovoked. When considering options available in a provocation with another person, everyone understands that the cops won’t show up in time to help and yet many people still don’t carry self-protection tools or techniques. You have the right to choose strategies, tools, and techniques to defend yourself and should be empowered to do so by not being forced or coerced into funding .....</p>
    </div>

<h3>Voluntaryism answers these questions:</h3>
    <div class= "bodytext">
        <p>What gives someone a right?<br><br>
        Do you have the right to delegate a right to someone that you don’t have yourself?<br><br>
        If you do not have the right to perform an action yourself, what gives you the right to elect someone to do it on your behalf? (hint: nothing)<br><br>

        Any solution requiring government extortion can and must be rethought.<br><br>
        The state has no legitimacy. We have the opportunity to constantly foster a voluntaryist setting. All of us who care must outweigh the few who actually want to make others suffer. If there’s an issue with a violation of the NAP, what a perfect time to discuss and practice some voluntary conflict resolution.<br><br>
        We want people to be able to pursue any avenue they want as long as it does not harm another individual or group. We recognize people have the ability to govern themselves because they own themselves.  We also then necessarily recognize that no individual nor group of individuals has authority over other individuals or groups.</p>
    </div>

<h3>Am I still a voluntaryist if…</h3>
    <div class= "bodytext">
        <h4>I vote?</h4>
            <p>It depends. Within the current system, you must be very choosy to be voluntaryist with your voting. In most cases, as with “electing officials”, you are forcing your opinion on another person.</p>

        <h4>I want to live by a set of rules?</h4>
            <p>Most likely, yes. All rules can coexist as long as they don’t initiate violence or coercion aka take away the consent of others. All forms of rules are ‘allowed’ as long as they don’t initiate violence or coercion.<br><br>
            </p>
    </div>

<h3>Am I a statist if…</h3>
    <div class= "bodytext">
        <h4>If I believe we need state to enforce rules?</h4>
            <p>Yes. Look into other means of rule enforcement. There is much literature on this.<br><br>
        <h4>If I think that humans cannot govern themselves?</h4>
            <p>Not necessarily. There are ways a voluntary society and free market can equitably deal with all sorts of situations.</p>
        <h4>If I believe in private property?</h4>
            <p>Not necessarily. There are many different views on property, but most Voluntaryists believe in private property.</p>
    </div>

<h3>Consent-Only Culture</h3>
    <div class= "bodytext">
        <p>There is no such thing as someone granting a right they do not have themselves. And nobody has a right to make a decision for someone else.<br><br>
        The game of rulers and subjects is just a story we tell ourselves. There are also people who stand up and defy the idea that they are subjects. They are the resistance. However, resisting tyranny does not require violence or aggression. We can build alternate networks of free people.</p>
    </div>

<h3>Without rulers. Not without rules.</h3>
    <div class= "bodytext">
        <p>It’s about who decides the rules over themselves and what is theirs. Do you feel like you have control?  In a voluntaryist society there is no legal way to aggress against others, and where you are free to determine the rules over your property.</p>
    </div>
<h2>Don’t choose the lesser of two evils:</h2>
    <div class= "bodytext">
        <p>A choice for the lesser of two evils is still a choice for evil and will always result in evil.  You never have to choose evil.  Just like the trajectory of all evil is more evil, the trajectory of all tyrants, both big and small, is more tyranny. The ends don’t justify the means. The means and the end are the same. Freedom must be taken.</p>
    </div>

<h2>We already live without rules</h2>
    <div class= "bodytext">
        <p>We identify as voluntaryists, which means we adhere to a philosophy based on the idea that all human interactions should be voluntary. The world we envision includes exclusively voluntary relations between equals rather than between rulers and subjects. Voluntaryism is the moral philosophy that all forms of human interaction should be voluntary and consensual, and that the only just use of force is defensive force.<br><br>
        “The State” is the belief that some people can possess authority (power and the right to exercise it) over other people.  This belief is a story people tell themselves.  The belief that some of us are rulers while the rest of us are subjects is just a story.  Some people stand up and defy tyrants.  They are the resistance.<br><br>
        We are all already Voluntaryists and we all already live in a state of freedom.  "The State" is just a lie that says there are some people who have the power and right to rule over all of the other people who are subjects with a duty to obey the rulers.  That is the lie we must undo.<br><br>
        We are providing opportunities and options so that people don’t have to seek services that the proceeds from are going towards the government and people who also drain their resources to the government; granting them lesser autonomy and the perpetuation of the ill-supplied agorist market.<br><br>
        Voluntaryism is very connected to Freedom because property rights and self-ownership do not necessitate coercion or force or telling others what they can and can’t do.</p>
    </div>
<h2>Abundance Loops</h2>
    <div class= "bodytext">
        <p>Creating an organism that adheres to a methodology that is designed to bring about freedom in this realm.<br><br>
        We define clear goals. So that when people come to the free realm, they know what they can do.<br><br>
        Our idea is strong because the more people get empowered by it, the more we are benefitted.<br><br>

        Allowing humans to make the decisions they would naturally make if they were presented with the option to. <br><br>
        For example, people will choose the cheaper option that is higher quality and more healthy.</p>
    </div>

<h3>Concentration of Wealth: Keeping it in the Family</h3>
    <div class= "bodytext">
        <p>In win-win interactions, there will always be two people that benefit. The other party in your interaction may be an ally or an enemy.  This simple truth is one most neglected in their day-to-day transactions.  In times both past and present, families would maintain economic dominance by passing on their wealth to the first-born son or daughter.  While we neither support nor oppose such practices, we recognize the value of keeping your wealth within your agorist network rather than watching it bleed back into the system.  You can expand this to “resource sharing” as well, choosing to specialize with or differentiate your offerings from others on your team.<br><br>
        If your time and effort are put into acquiring products you know are of high value, you should try to pass that value on to trusted members of your network who will recognize and likely utilize your product (such as a quality truck you acquired) toward your common goal of abolishing slavery by ending the State by taking your agorism seriously and directing your wealth in a way that empowers yourself and the allies who are fighting the same fight you are.<br><br>

        When you give your time and resources to another in a voluntary exchange, give to those who seek to concentrate their wealth into their network/family/community that focuses on manifesting anarchy beyond themselves.  Is the person you're selling your goods/services to an anarchist who is actively seeking to manifest anarchy for others?  Or are you giving your fruits away to be funneled/fed back into the statist paradigm/system?  Vote with your wealth.  Let your wealth work for you toward what you're here to accomplish: the abolishment of slavery and freedom of humanity.<br><br>

        If you're going to take time and focus from other anarchists, do so in a way that focuses on manifesting anarchy for others.  If you're going to seek help with things on your property that won't or don't manifest anarchy beyond yourself, then look for statists to fulfill those tasks since they'll at least be wasting their time in a way that benefits you while dodging government extortion fees ("taxes").  This then frees (or at least doesn't tie up) the time and focus of anarchists to manifest more freedom and grow the wealth and infrastructure of the network.  Of course, that is not to say that you shouldn't pay other anarchists to tend your own garden for example, just don't pretend like that's in some way making the world more free if it doesn't do anything to actually free anybody.<br><br>

        It's the taxation that fucking sucks, NOT the degree to which you feel misrepresented by your political overlords.

<h2>We are creating abundance loops.</h2>
    <div class= "bodytext">
        <p>An abundance loop is when you find a way to both thrive and have some excess prosperity. We are funneling this towards people who also can create abundance loops. The proliferation of abundance loops will spiral outwards from our own excess.
        As travelers, we are able to sell people's goods just by being where we were going to be already. Our gas money is already accounted for before we will even pick up and travel at all. <br><br>
        You do not have to constantly burn gas to be a nomad - but when the network has a supply for the huge demand we currency face for agorist goods - it becomes very lucrative to travel. The opportunity to travel becomes too expensive to pass up.
        This is because within the reality we exist within, being a traveler is a boon as long as there are suppliers of products because there is always a market for agorist products. That is why it becomes important for us to crowdfund farms and producers of agorist goods.<br><br>
        We have a loop that says: We can do this. There is a need that they will fill. We have the extra piece that needed filling. We will work to fill in the missing piece instead of letting it thwart us. <br><br>
        Which people will understand and continue the feedback loop?</p>
    </div>

<h1>Philosophy of Abundance</h1>

<h2>Win-win</h2>
    <div class= "bodytext">
        <p>By choosing not to abide by the zero aggression principle or other related concepts principles, or boundaries, a person effectively signs and hands over a contract stating that, by their performative actions, they consent to be treated as they treat others. After all, morality is universal. <br><br>
        It doesn’t matter if people don’t agree with each other. People need to know that when they act upon others, they are saying that they believe that is how people should act upon them.</p>
    </div>

<h2>Our Exit Strategy:</h2>
    <div class= "bodytext">
        <p>Government should be optional, not required.  We are FREE people, are we not? We aren’t trying to abolish the State.  If there are people who still wish to use a State for provision of specific goods or services, they should still be free to contract in such ways, but again, they in the NEW realm will enter into such contracts voluntarily and with the free-will choice to say no without punishment or retaliation.<br><br>
        The idea is to help everyone who is having trouble redirecting their income stream and expenditures to purely agorist sources - so that we can keep the wealth in the family and grow a system that will stand resolute against all threats.<br><br>
        We know this will work and we want to help form and strengthen the bonds that will replace weak supply lines currently “providing” for us. The necessity of the State is the story we tell ourselves. We can get everyone we know to stop telling that story. We are building a network of capable people who can protect each other and the world. We are on voluntary teams that work outside of the government.<br><br>
        We have a business model that cannot fail. The value people are already generating can be redirected towards the agorist network and thus go much further towards true growth and prosperity. This enables a lifestyle maximized for freedom.<br><br>
        All interactions we take part in are in a free and sovereign world. We are taking all transactions out of the city. We are making sure the money we spend goes towards a system that will protect us, not towards a system that will hurt us. So every interaction should be taken from the government/taxes and utilized by only voluntaryists who are making the new world.<br><br>
        We are creating spaces that you can live in free of charge so that you can detox for as long as you need. Our network provides a means of achieving whatever life goals you have in a way that doesn’t fund wars but actually helps others gain security. You will see the way in which you can finally align yourself with the way you are acting out your own real-life adventure. We have a way to help you expand your impact on those you care about while reducing your risk and the risk of those you do business with. With our network, you have the prospect of real security, wealth, privacy, and community. On top of all of this, you will witness the structure of the world change based on your input.<br><br>
        When you see what is really possible in this moment, in this lifetime, you will see the value of embarking on your own journey in the Realm. All it takes is spreading this knowledge to the people who will want to do something about it and create the change they want to see.<br><br>
        The knowledge of our slavery is hardly as important as the knowledge of our power and all the tools and manpower that we already have at our disposal to fight back against tyrants through nonviolent, non-confrontational means.
