<h1><strong>Rewrite Your Future</strong></h1>
<h4>What do you want to achieve?</h4>
<p>Take what you&rsquo;ve learned so far, and use it to change your idea of your future.</p>
<h3><strong>The Road to the Top</strong></h3>
<p>To become the person we want to be, we will go through a complex combination of steps including steps of healing, remembering, dreaming, regrouping, feeling lost, feeling angry, and then coming back again and again to what it is that drives you.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not too hard to opt-out if you have enough support. And this network is providing the extra support needed to those who don&rsquo;t already have a network, just as we all do when we are starting something.</p>
<h3><strong>Do you ever feel like your plan could be larger?&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<p>Do you ever fantasize about a world in which restrictions currently in place don&rsquo;t hinder you at every turn? Do you have a &ldquo;realistic plan&rdquo; and yet also an idea for how much greater your impact would be if there was just more freedom in the world? We are on the path to the creation of that world today. We achieve this by continuing to act as free and sovereign individuals while broadening our network so that we can begin to see the results of our efforts to make the world a better and safer place for future generations.</p>
<h3><strong>Would you like to have only voluntary interactions from now on?&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<p>Imagine a world with only voluntary interactions. It&rsquo;s hard to imagine that every claim to authority ever feigned could easily be shown to be completely falsified, but it is just that simple. You cannot prove that you have authority over another man or his property.</p>
<h2><strong>What You Bring:</strong></h2>
<h4>The most valuable resource</h4>
<p>The goal is to become aware of which areas you want to advance in your life to maximize your machine and thus your effect on freedom everywhere.</p>
<p>Our own energy and attention are our most ill-utilized resources. Our own worth is used frivolously, starting from the levels of government indoctrination centers many attend from a young age. Even simpler than this is the fact that humans are told that they are in debt since birth, racking up carbon footprint murder points for making simple self-care choices like taking a shower for longer than 5 minutes.</p>
<p>Not only do we, as humans, provide essential nutrients to the ground, but the breath we exhale is all in perfect alignment with the world around us. We propagate new crops and create paths and shelter that can be utilized by other creatures when we are gone. Never once do we step outside of line with this harmony until we promote those things that restrict and limit human free will and ingenuity. (destruction of freedom) We value humans who overcome these restrictions.</p>

<h1><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></h1>
<h4>What We Value</h4>
<p>Most of all, we value voluntaryists (people who follow the ZAP) who wish to manifest freedom beyond just themselves and their own situation.</p>
<p>We also value individuals who wish to circumvent the &ldquo;state&rdquo; through counter-economics (a.k.a Agorism) that take measures to prevent their wealth, once exchanged for other things of value, from landing in the hands of evil people.&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Get Involved Today</strong></h3>
<p>For those who want to get involved but don&rsquo;t know how that would look, you don&rsquo;t have to go far. We are creating meetups in every city along our trade route. Soon, you will go to voluntaryist events in a rotation of cities or go to one in your hometown.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are ready to leave your situation today, the caravan is the most immediate form of aid. We have 5 vehicles and the mobile camping infrastructure setup available where we can share resources in a loose, slow-moving caravan with the aim of ending slavery today through education, agorism, and encouraging the connection between new and already made alternative networks.</p>
<p>If you want a stationary option, there are many agorist locations that will help you along the path towards freedom. These are listed in Chapter 3, Transcending Location.</p>
<h1><br /><br /></h1>
<h1>Create Your Role</h1>
<h3><strong>Work/Life</strong></h3>
<h4>a lifestyle maximized for freedom.</h4>
<p>Whatever roles you want to play in the world, short or long-term, you are capable of creating the best plan for how those roles will be played out. You may want to learn from others for a time, but eventually, you will trust your own expertise on the subject and will be the one best suited to the task of planning your method and approach.</p>
<p>The current system has us doing all kinds of acrobatics with licenses, restrictions, and taxes that create bars to entry in most major industries. We have the power to step away from these issues, but we need to also have a market to step into - a demand for our services. That is the purpose of the network. You can create a new name for your profession or just a new description of the possibilities within it.</p>
<p>The network we are working on opposes the idea of keeping a profession that funds the state. That&rsquo;s why we are working to expand the number of jobs available within the network that meet these criteria: they do not fund the state or people who fund the state. Eventually, this will look like all participants in all transactions not funding the state with their shelter, job, food, or leisure activities.</p>
<h3><strong>The Inhumanity of Modern Work</strong></h3>
<p>The system is rigged so that we can&rsquo;t spend our time in a way that is constantly bettering our situation. In order to better our situation, we must get a job. But a job is stagnant - in general, it does not allow you to constantly innovate how you spend your time and how the job works. Not only do jobs promote stagnant time in our day, but a person must be perceived as stable to get most jobs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A job in itself is not bad. But the common understanding of a job is tied to a common understanding of the world - in which all commerce must be tied to the state under threat of punishment. It is rare that the actual time and activities spent in a day align with a person&rsquo;s ideal working environment. We may earn wealth, but what we are doing to grow ourselves toward our greater selves is often limited if we choose to seek money over spending time growing ourselves in other ways.</p>
<p>In the current paradigm, we can&rsquo;t easily spend our time in a way that is constantly bettering our situation.</p>
<p>In order to better our situation, we must get a job. But a job is stagnant - in general, it does not allow you to constantly innovate how you spend your time and how the job works.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not only do jobs promote stagnant time in our day once we have one, but to get most jobs a person must be perceived as stable.</p>
<p>You must often have a house or several that you homestead on a regular basis (rent or mortgage usually being a requirement of further government certification associated with most accepted jobs).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Society shuns those who don&rsquo;t adhere to these norms. Or if a person does support companies that break these standards - it is from a couch, by definition - because there is not yet a network filling the gap and providing for them a way to do things better.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you haven&rsquo;t dug a deep hole into the business of paying for government &lsquo;licenses&rsquo; and &lsquo;taxes&rsquo;, you won&rsquo;t be so devastated when the tides of business change and break free from these chains.</p>
<h3><strong>Healthy Jobs</strong></h3>
<p>It is easy to surmise that there are many health reasons to avoid repetitive physical or mental tasks such as standing still for long periods of time with your focus somewhere else. But there are many more problems when it comes to the modern-day workweek than just these. It&rsquo;s not only that we should be able to find work that is seamless with whatever life we want to live - we don&rsquo;t have to work to live at all if we don&rsquo;t want to. Our network makes this possible with structures like freedom properties.</p>
<p>We must live out our wildest reality - for only those actions will create the world we want to live in and inspire others through.</p>
<h4>How to Make Money With Agorism</h4>
<p>Whatever job you have, it can translate into the agora.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any profession can be transferred to an agorist modality. So rather than changing the names of professions, it&rsquo;s about transforming the day-to-day realities of those positions. It&rsquo;s about being able to make decisions that fit our own personal moral framework (so long as it follows the ZAP). Thus, our lives and positions will mean the things we want them to mean - and effect the change we want to affect. We can live in a world where everyone is empowered to make their own voluntaryist mark upon the world.</p>
<p>The potential life paths we are presented with in school and by our family and peers are flawed. Most of our dreams, in order to become big and remain &lsquo;legal&rsquo; in the eyes of the government, require expensive licenses, taxes, and other advertising barriers that make it hard to succeed in the modern world where every minute of screen time is bought.</p>
<p>Following in the footsteps of the generations before us, The new generation is already recognizing the lie of secondary education. It is very mainstream now to hear stories of people succeeding without a college degree or tons of money to start off with. But the stories are of people who succeeded despite the land mines thrown into the path of the everyday person by the very government that is supposed to be serving them. Why aren&rsquo;t we hearing more about the government&rsquo;s direct connection with suffering? Because then we might realize it doesn&rsquo;t need to exist.</p>
<h3><strong>Become Your Best Self</strong></h3>
<p>We are told horror stories of people cast out by society and told that the only way to really survive is to do it while obeying every law that is decided for you by unknown individuals under the guise of your fellow Americans.</p>
<p>Everyone has their own unique combination of skills and interests, and each person's character classes will be something that they discover over time, and create new names for if they choose; which only approximates a description of the whole person who is always growing and updating their own understanding of themselves.</p>
<p>Everyone deserves some time to detox from society and decide what they would be doing with their lives if they really had the freedom to create a life they wanted to live. This involves trying their hand at different skills and living in different environments. It also includes and requires a detox from the nervous system overload which is the modern-day measuring stick of success in the cities of America.</p>
